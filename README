# 我的注释
这个库用gcc11（ubuntu22默认）编译会提示num_journals的重定义；用gcc8编译正常。
gcc11编译元胤稍微改了include和/或变量extern定义就能正常编译了有时间试下。

This is the new version (1.45.3) of the second extended file
system management programs.

	From time to time, I release new versions of e2fsprogs, to fix
bugs and to make the utilities more robust.  You can always find
information about the latest version at the the e2fsprogs web page,
which is:

	http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net

	The INSTALL file has instructions on building and installing
e2fsprogs.  Provisions for building Red Hat RPMs and Debian dpkg files
are supplied as well.

	In case of bugs in these programs, please contact Ted Ts'o at
tytso@mit.edu or tytso@alum.mit.edu.  See the e2fsck man page for
suggestions of what sort of information to include when submitting bug
reports for these programs.
